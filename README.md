<h1>Managing state</h1>
Here I have used 2 states which by default build in React.
<ul>
 <li>
  <h3> useState </h3>
By using useState I have stored the main component data that I want to send to its child component and pass it to the child component by using props
 </li>
 <li>
<h3> useEffect </h3>
useEffect Hook is used for handling side effects in functional components. It can be used for data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions. I have used it for fetching my fake data from the data.json folder
 </li>
</ul>
