Coursera. Three key Features of this project are written below

<h1>Managing state</h1>
Here I have used 2 states which by default build in React.
- useState
By using useState I have stored the main component data that I want to send to its child component and pass it to the child component by using props
- useEffect
useEffect Hook is used for handling side effects in functional components. It can be used for data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions. I have used it for fetching my fake data from the data.json folder
